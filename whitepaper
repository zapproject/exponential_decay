### **2. Mechanism Design (Revised)**  
#### **2.2 Exit Tax Reinvestment**  
When tokens are sold, **99% of the exit tax is reinvested into the bonding curve’s reserve pool**, while 1% is burned. This creates a **self-reinforcing price floor** and stabilizes long-term growth.  

- **Tax Decay Formula**:  
  \[
  T(t) = 0.99 \times e^{-0.04652t} \quad \text{(Tax decays from 99% → 0% over 100 days)}
  \]  

- **Reserve Growth**: For a sale of `x` tokens held for `t` days:  
  \[
  \Delta R = x \times P(n) \times T(t) \quad \text{(Tax reinvested into reserve)}
  \]  
  \[
  \text{Burned} = x \times P(n) \times 0.01 \quad \text{(1% of tax burned)}
  \]  

#### **2.3 Updated Bonding Curve with Tax Reinvestment**  
The token price `P(n)` is now determined by the **reserve-enhanced bonding curve**:  
\[
P(n) = \frac{R(n)}{n} \quad \text{where } R(n) = \int_0^n P(s) \, ds + \sum \Delta R
\]  
- `R(n)`: Total reserve (initial bonding curve liquidity + cumulative reinvested tax).  
- `ΣΔR`: Sum of all taxes reinvested from previous sales.

### **3. Key Features (Revised)**  
#### **3.2 Reinvestment Mechanics**  
- **Price Stability**: Early sales inject tax back into reserves, counteracting sell pressure.  
- **Positive Feedback Loop**: High early taxes (99%) dramatically boost reserves, raising the price floor.  
- **Long-Term Growth**: As tax decays, organic demand drives price.  

#### **3.4 Example Scenario with Reinvestment**  
- **Day 1**: Alice sells 100,000 tokens at `P(n) = \$0.0025`:  
  - **Tax**: `T(1) = 94.5%` → Reinvested tax = `100,000 × 0.0025 × 0.945 = \$236.25`.  
  - **New Reserve**: Increased by \$236.25, raising the price for subsequent buyers.  
  - **Burned**: `100,000 × 0.0025 × 0.01 = \$2.50`.  

- **Day 30**: Reserve has grown from repeated tax reinvestment, pushing `P(n)` higher than the original curve.

### **4. Mathematical Proof of Stability**  
#### **4.1 Reserve Growth Equation**  
After `m` sales of `x` tokens each:  
\[
R(n) = \underbrace{\int_0^n 0.0001 \times e^{0.0001s} \, ds}_{\text{Original Bonding Curve}} + \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^m x_i \times P(n_i) \times T(t_i)}_{\text{Reinvested Tax}}
\]  
- **Result**: The reserve `R(n)` grows super-linearly, steepening the bonding curve.  

#### **4.2 Price Impact**  
Reinvested tax increases the reserve faster than supply (`n`), leading to:  
\[
P_{\text{new}}(n) = \frac{R(n)}{n} > P_{\text{original}}(n)
\]  
- **Example**: At `n = 50,000`, `P_original = \$0.82`, but `P_new` could reach \$1.20 due to tax reinvestment.

### **5. Updated Tokenomics Table**  
| Parameter            | Value           | Effect                          |  
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|  
| Initial Tax          | 99%             | Maximizes reserve growth        |  
| Tax Decay Rate       | 0.04652/day     | Smooth transition to 0% tax     |  
| Burn Rate            | 1% of tax       | Deflationary pressure           |  
| Reserve Growth       | 99% of tax      | Price stability + upside        |

### **6. Benefits of Reinvested Tax**  
1. **Dump Resistance**: Early sellers unintentionally fund higher prices for holders.  
2. **Holder Confidence**: Rising reserve acts as a publicly auditable “backing” for the token.  
3. **Sustainable Demand**: Combines viral bonding curve mechanics with compounding reserve growth.  

---

### **7. Technical Implementation**  
- **Smart Contract Modifications**:  
  1. Track `R(n)` in real-time (reserve = initial liquidity + reinvested tax - burned amounts).  
  2. Automatically update `P(n)` using `R(n)/n`.  
- **User Dashboard**: Display reserve growth and tax-reinforced price projections.

### **8. Comparison to Pump.fun (Revised)**  
| Feature               | Pump.fun        | PumpHodl v2     |  
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
| **Price Stability**   | Low             | High (Tax-Reinforced) |  
| **Reserve Growth**    | None            | Exponential      |  
| **Dump Impact**       | Severe          | Net Positive (Boosts Reserve) |

### **9. Conclusion**  
By reinvesting exit taxes into the bonding curve’s reserve, PumpHodl v2 transforms short-term speculation into long-term price stability. This creates a flywheel effect where early volatility fuels sustainable growth, aligning incentives across all token holders.
